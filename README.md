# Valley of Shaders
Small project to learn shaders and optimalization in Godot Engine

## Goals

- terrain shader optimalization
- terrain shader coloring (without textures)
- units movement optimalization (using heightmap)
- camera movement
- selecting/giving orders to units
- easy changing levels (terrains)
